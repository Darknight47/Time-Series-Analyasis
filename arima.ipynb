    "## Introduction to ARIMA\n",
    "#### What is ARIMA?\n",
    "ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a class of statistical models designed for analyzing and forecasting time series data.  \n",
    "ARIMA models are built upon three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AutoRegressive (AR)**: This refers to the model's ability to predict future values based on past values. It uses a linear combination of lagged observations.\n",
    "2. **Integrated (I)**: This refers to the differencing of raw observations to make the time series stationary (i.e., the mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure of the series do not change over time).\n",
    "3. **Moving Average (MA)**: This involves modeling the error of the forecast as a linear combination of error terms from past time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components are combined into a single model represented as ARIMA **(p,d,q)**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $p$: The number of lag observations included in the AR model (autoregressive terms).\n",
    "2. $d$: The degree of differencing required to make the series stationary.\n",
    "3. $q$: The size of the moving average window (moving average terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Does ARIMA Solve?\n",
    "ARIMA is designed to solve forecasting problems for time series data. It provides a method to predict future values based on patterns and relationships within the historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Typical problems ARIMA addresses include:\n",
    "1. Forecasting future sales or demand.\n",
    "2. Predicting stock prices or economic indicators.\n",
    "3. Anticipating seasonal trends in temperature, rainfall, or traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When Should ARIMA Be Used?\n",
    "1. **The data is a time series**: ARIMA is specifically for data points recorded in sequential time order.\n",
    "2. **There is a need for accurate forecasts**: Itâ€™s particularly effective for series that are autocorrelated (past values influence future values).\n",
    "3. **The series is stationary or can be made stationary**: ARIMA assumes the series has a constant mean and variance over time. Non-stationary series can often be transformed using differencing.\n",
    "4. **There are no clear seasonal effects**: For data with strong seasonal patterns, the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) extension is often better.\n"
