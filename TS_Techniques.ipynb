    "### What is Time Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Time Series** is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at regular intervals over time. The data is typically sequential and chronologically ordered.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Daily temperature readings.\n",
    "2. Monthly sales of a product.\n",
    "3. Stock market prices captured hourly or daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series data is unique because its values are influenced by the **order** in which they occur, making **time** a critical variable in analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does Time Series Solve?\n",
    "Time Series addresses problems where understanding or predicting patterns over time is essential. It can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand historical patterns**:\n",
    "    1. Detect trends, seasonality, and cyclical behaviors in the data.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Analyzing a store's sales over serveral years to identify peak seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forecast the Future**:\n",
    "    1. Generate predictions based on past trends and patterns.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Forecasting demand for electricity based on historical usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detect Anomalies**:\n",
    "    1. Identify unusual or unexpected events in the sequence.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Spotting fraudulent activity in transaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Understand Dependencies Over Time**:\n",
    "    1. Explore how past values influence future values.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Studying how today's stock prices relate to yesterday's.\n",
