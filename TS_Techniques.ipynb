    "### What is Time Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Time Series** is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at regular intervals over time. The data is typically sequential and chronologically ordered.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Daily temperature readings.\n",
    "2. Monthly sales of a product.\n",
    "3. Stock market prices captured hourly or daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series data is unique because its values are influenced by the **order** in which they occur, making **time** a critical variable in analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does Time Series Solve?\n",
    "Time Series addresses problems where understanding or predicting patterns over time is essential. It can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand historical patterns**:\n",
    "    1. Detect trends, seasonality, and cyclical behaviors in the data.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Analyzing a store's sales over serveral years to identify peak seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forecast the Future**:\n",
    "    1. Generate predictions based on past trends and patterns.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Forecasting demand for electricity based on historical usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detect Anomalies**:\n",
    "    1. Identify unusual or unexpected events in the sequence.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Spotting fraudulent activity in transaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Understand Dependencies Over Time**:\n",
    "    1. Explore how past values influence future values.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Studying how today's stock prices relate to yesterday's.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where is Time Series Analysis Used?\n",
    "1. **Finance**: Predicting stock prices, interest rates, and currency values.\n",
    "2. **Retail**: Forecasting demand for inventory management and supply chain optimization.\n",
    "3. **Healthcare**: Monitoring patient vitals or predicting disease trends.\n",
    "4. **Weather and Climate**: Forecasting temperatures, rainfall, or global climate patterns.\n",
    "5. **Manufacturing**: Monitoring equipment for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.\n",
    "6. **Economics**: Modelling GDP growth, unemployment rates, or inflation over time.\n",
    "7. **Energy**: Forecasting energy consumption or production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should Time Series be used?\n",
    "1. **Extracting Insights**\n",
    "    1. Understand how and why data changes over time.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** A retailer can learn how promotions influence weekly sales trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data-Driven Decisions**\n",
    "    1. Enable informed planning based on forecasted trends.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Budgeting based on projected revenue trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mitigating Risks**\n",
    "    1. Anticipate issues like supply shortages or system failures.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Predicting a machine breakdown using sensor data trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improving Efficiency**\n",
    "    1. Optimize operations by predicting demands or resource needs.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Adjusting staffing levels based on forecasted customer footfall."

    "Time Series Decomposition is a technique that breaks down a time series into **distinct components** to better understand its structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend (T):**\n",
    "    1. The long-term direction in the data.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** A steady increase in sales over years.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Seasonality (S):**\n",
    "    1. Regular, repeating patterns occurring at fixed intervals (e.g. daily, monthly, yearly)\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Ice cream sales peaking every summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Residual or Noise (R):**\n",
    "    1. The random, unpredictable variations that cannot be explained by trend or seasonality.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Sudden sales spikes due to unexpected events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, **an optional cyclical component** is also considered:\n",
    "    1. **Cycliality:** Long-term fluctuations that don't have a fixed period but occur due to economic or external factors.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** Economic booms and recessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decomposition assumes the time series follows one of these models:\n",
    "1. **Additive Model:** \n",
    "2. $Y_i = T_i + S_t + R_t$ Used when the variations in seasonality and noise are **constant** in magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiplicative Model:**\n",
    "2. $Y_t = T_t * S_t * R_t$ Used when the variations in seasonality and noise **increase** or **decrease** with the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does decomposition solve?\n",
    "1. **Understand Patterns:**\n",
    "    1. It helps identify the underlying trend, seasonal effects, and random noise separetly.\n",
    "    2. **Example:** A retailer can isolate the effect of Black Friday sales from long-term growth trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepares data for modelling:**\n",
    "    1. By removing seasonality and trends, decomposition helps create a stationary time series, which is essential for many forecasting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Improves forecasting accuarcy:**\n",
    "    1. Isolating components like seasonality and trends allows for more precise predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anomaly Detection:**\n",
    "    1. Once the trend and seasonality are modeled, deviations (residuals) can highlight anomalies or unexpected events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should decomposition be used?\n",
    "1. **Simplifying complex data:** Breaking down the series into components makes it easier to interpret.\n",
    "2. **Identifying key influences:** Pinpointing trends or seasonal patterns help businesses make informed decisions.\n",
    "3. **Refining forecasting models:** Models that separately handle trends and seasonality often outperform those that don't.\n",
    "3. **Preparing for advanced techniques:** Many times series methods (e.g. ARIMA) require stationary data, which decomposition helps achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When should decomposition be used?\n",
    "1. **When the series shows seasonality:** If the data exhibits repeating patterns (monthly sales.)\n",
    "2. **For data exploration**\n",
    "3. **Before Forecasting:** To remove trend and seasonality, enabling better predictions.\n",
    "4. **To identify anomalies**\n",
    "5. **To preprocess data**"
